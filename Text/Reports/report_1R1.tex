\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{A} clear and simple Recommended Structure of a repository for scientific Projects is crucial for the entire scientific research project.So we build our own git repository based on the recommend structure proposed by \citet{2020A}.
At the same time, a clear understanding of the internal characteristics of each team member is also helpful for follow-up study and research. 
Based on this, we submitted a document written in \LaTeX, which contains a detailed introduction of each team member.


\section{Team Members}

Qingyu Luo is a person who is keen to explore how technology can improve people's production and life, and has the qualities of diligence and innovation. He is reliable and inspiring in teamwork.

Junxiao Li has enthusiasm, is a man of focus, isn't afraid of dealing with difficulties, and would like to figure out which troubles with him. %%% ACF Strange closing; please be clear about this.
Have working experience in student clubs, he has a strong sense of responsibility and work coordination ability. 
He has experience in mathematical modeling competitions and a certain foundation of programming modeling.

Jiawen Wang is a cheerful, honest and upright girl from Xi'an, an ancient capital city. With the experience of participating in mathematical modeling competitions, she has some programming modeling background and hopes to go far in the academic path.

Chaozhuo Hua, an intelligent young man, lively and lovely is his indispensable feature, who has a strong heart, also, optimistic and persistent personality, aggressive, dare to face difficulties and challenges.
